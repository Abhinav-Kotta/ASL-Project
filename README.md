# ASL-Project
 Using MediaPipe to detect different sign language gestures.

## Stuff You Need:
 1. Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet  
 **Note:** draw_landmarks.py processes whatever files you give it. So it can take up to an hour to annotate the dataset
 
## Task List:
- [ ] Finish automating annotations
- [ ] Incorporate more data
- [ ] Create a demo application: follow the tutorial below  and refactor the code (around the first half of the video)
- [ ] Find storage places for data
